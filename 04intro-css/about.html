        <h1>About SaveurQuest and Founder Mindy Martin</h1>

        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p>SaveurQuest was born from a passion for discovering authentic flavors and hidden outdoor gems around the
            world. Founded by Mindy Martin as a division of Flavors on the Move LLC, our new venture specializes in
            taking travelers beyond typical tourist experiences to find <em>genuine cultural connections</em> through
            food and nature.</p>

        <p>Based in the beautiful mountain town of Oakley, Utah, we understand the value of combining spectacular
            natural landscapes with exceptional culinary discoveries. Our location in Summit County provides the perfect
            launching point for both local Utah adventures and international expeditions.</p>

        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p>We believe that <strong>authentic travel</strong> happens when you step away from crowded tourist spots and
            engage directly with local communities. Our carefully curated tours focus on:</p>

        <!-- Another unordered list -->
